# Sandboxed Coding Agents on Shared Servers

Docker-based sandbox environments for running **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex CLI** in full-autonomy mode on shared Linux servers — installed by one command per agent.

The problem this solves: you want to run a coding agent with permission prompts disabled (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--yolo`), but you don't trust the agent to respect instructions like "don't touch files outside this directory." Instead of trusting the agent, these setups make the boundary physical: the agent runs in a container where **the only host path it can see is the project directory you launched it from**, plus small named volumes for credentials and state.

Design principles:

- **Docker is the sandbox.** No reliance on agent self-restraint or agent-internal sandboxing.
- **Log in once.** Auth tokens persist in per-user named volumes across sessions, rebuilds and upgrades.
- **Minimal images.** The image is a sandbox skeleton plus everyday toolchains (C, Python, Rust). Anything else a project needs gets installed into that project's own directory (`./.jdk`, `./.bin`, `./.venv`) — resist adding it to the image.
- **Per-user everything.** Image, volume and container names are namespaced by `$USER`, and the image is built with your UID, so multiple users on a shared rootful Docker daemon don't collide.

## Install

**Linux, macOS, or inside WSL2:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/claude.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/codex.sh  | bash
```

**Windows (native, no WSL) — in PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/claude.ps1 | iex
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/codex.ps1  | iex
```

The installer puts the launcher in `~/.local/bin`, and no script can change
the `PATH` of the shell that ran it. If that directory wasn't already on your
`PATH`, wrap the command in `eval` and it will be:

```bash
eval "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/claude.sh | bash)"
```

Everything the installer prints goes to stderr, so the only thing `eval` ever
sees is the one `export PATH=...` line — and only when it is needed. Run it
without `eval` and the installer prints that line for you to paste instead.

Install either agent, or both — they share nothing but the `PATH` entry. See [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md) for which Windows route to pick (WSL2 is recommended, and uses the bash installers above).

**Docker is the only prerequisite,** and you don't have to work out how to get it: if it's missing or unreachable, the installer stops and prints the exact commands for your system — `apt-get`/`dnf`/`pacman` with the docker-group step on Linux, `brew install --cask docker` (or colima, or OrbStack) on macOS, `winget install Docker.DockerDesktop` on Windows, and the Docker Desktop WSL-integration toggle inside WSL. It also tells apart "not installed", "daemon not running" and "you're not in the docker group", because the fix differs.

### First run

```bash
cd ~/some-project
claude-sandbox                                     # log in once (token persists)
claude-sandbox --dangerously-skip-permissions      # accept the bypass dialog once

codex-sandbox login --device-auth                  # device code, approve at chatgpt.com
```

If the installer had to add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`, it says so and
prints the one line that fixes the terminal you are in:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

New terminals pick it up from your shell's rc file. For bash that means
`~/.bashrc`, plus `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.profile`) when that file exists and
doesn't source `~/.bashrc` — otherwise a login shell, which is what a new
Terminal window on macOS and every ssh session gives you, would never read it.
The line the installer writes re-checks `$PATH` at shell start, so it is
harmless in both files and never stacks a second copy.

## Daily use

```bash
cd ~/some-project
claude-sandbox --dangerously-skip-permissions
codex-sandbox                     # no flag needed; autonomy comes from config.toml
```

**In tmux, for sessions that survive an SSH disconnect** (Linux/macOS):

```bash
claude-sandbox --sandbox-tmux --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This starts (or re-attaches to) a tmux session named for the current project and drops you straight into it. Detach with `Ctrl-b d`; re-attach later — including from a phone SSH client — with the same command, or `tmux attach -t claude-<project>`. Quitting the agent normally (`/exit`, `Ctrl-d`) ends the session; if the agent exits with an error the pane waits for Enter so the output isn't lost. `--sandbox-tmux-detached` starts it in the background without attaching. Two different directories that share a basename get separate sessions rather than one hijacking the other's, and running it from inside tmux runs directly instead of nesting.

Everything else you pass is handed to the agent untouched. The launcher recognises a few flags of its own, **only in first position**:

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--sandbox-git` | also forward a git credential, so the agent can push — see [Git](#git) |
| `--sandbox-tmux` / `--sandbox-tmux-detached` | run inside a tmux session for this project |
| `--sandbox-doctor` | report on image, volumes, UIDs, versions — start here when something's wrong |
| `--sandbox-upgrade` | re-run the installer to update |
| `--sandbox-version` / `--sandbox-help` | version, and the list above |

## Git

**Your name and email are passed in automatically**, so the agent can commit.
Without them `git commit` fails outright inside the container ("Author identity
unknown"), and an autonomous agent works around that by inventing an identity —
either one that vanishes at session exit, or one it writes into your real
`.git/config` through the bind mount. The launcher reads the *effective*
`user.name` / `user.email` from the directory you launch in, so a repo-local
override is respected. No secret is involved and nothing is mounted.

**Pushing needs `--sandbox-git`**, which is opt-in per session:

```bash
claude-sandbox --sandbox-git --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

That resolves a credential on the *host* — from `$GH_TOKEN`, else `gh auth
token`, else your own git credential helper — and passes it in as environment.
Because the host does the lookup, it works the same whether your credentials
live in macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, libsecret, or a plain file;
the container never learns which.

Two limits worth knowing:

- **HTTPS remotes only.** An `ssh://` or `git@host:path` remote never consults a
  credential helper, so there is nothing to forward. The launcher says so rather
  than failing later.
- **Scoped to the origin's host, not to the repo.** The credential is installed
  as `credential.https://<host>.helper`, so it is never offered to any other
  host — but within that host, whatever the token can reach, the agent can
  reach. Use a fine-grained token.

`--sandbox-doctor` reports what would be passed (never the credential itself),
and `SANDBOX_NO_GIT=1` turns the whole thing off.

## Upgrading

**Re-run the same install command.** It is idempotent: it compares what's on disk against what it ships, rewrites only what changed, and rebuilds the image only if the Dockerfile changed. Your login volumes are never touched.

```bash
claude-sandbox --sandbox-upgrade        # shortcut for re-running the installer
claude-sandbox --sandbox-doctor         # what's installed, and is it current?
```

**If you installed before this repo was renamed** (it was `llm-coding-docker-sandbox-instructions`), nothing breaks: your launcher has the old URL compiled into it, and GitHub keeps serving that path, so the update check and `--sandbox-upgrade` both keep working. Re-running the install command above replaces the baked-in URL with the current one.

Once a day, at most, a launcher checks whether a newer sandbox has been published and prints a one-line note if so. It has a two-second ceiling, is silent when offline, and never blocks a launch. Turn it off with `SANDBOX_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

Claude Code itself doesn't need any of this — it self-updates inside the container, into a volume that survives rebuilds. Codex has no updater, so its launcher checks the npm registry and rebuilds when a new release ships (a no-op when you're current).

If you've edited an installed file yourself, an upgrade backs your version up to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` before replacing it, and says so. A Codex `config.toml` you've changed is left alone entirely.

## Checking and removing

```bash
curl -fsSL .../install/claude.sh | bash -s -- --check       # report status, change nothing
curl -fsSL .../install/claude.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall   # remove files and image; keep your login
curl -fsSL .../install/claude.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall --purge   # also delete the volumes
```

`--uninstall` deliberately leaves the named volumes alone, so uninstalling doesn't log you out. `--purge` deletes them and asks first. Other flags: `--force`, `--prefix DIR`, `--src-dir DIR`, `--no-build`, `--no-path-edit`, `--yes`, `--quiet`, `--help`. In PowerShell they're `-Check`, `-Uninstall`, `-Purge`, `-Force`, `-Prefix`, `-PrintPath`, and so on; because a piped script can't take arguments, use:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mriffle/llm-cli-docker-sandbox/main/install/claude.ps1))) -Check
```

## What gets installed

```
~/claude-sandbox/Dockerfile               image definition
~/codex-sandbox/Dockerfile                image definition
~/codex-sandbox/config.toml               Codex autonomy settings — yours to edit
~/.local/bin/claude-sandbox               launcher
~/.local/bin/codex-sandbox                launcher
~/.local/share/agent-sandbox/*.manifest   what was installed, and its hashes
```

On native Windows the launchers land in `%USERPROFILE%\bin` as a `.ps1` plus a `.cmd` shim (so they work from `cmd.exe` and never trip PowerShell's execution policy), and the manifest lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agent-sandbox`.

Nothing outside these paths is touched, except one guarded two-line block appended to your shell rc file if `~/.local/bin` isn't already on `PATH` — and to your login rc file as well when that one wouldn't otherwise read it.

`-PrintPath` is the PowerShell counterpart to the `eval` form above; it writes the session's `PATH` command to the success stream so `... -PrintPath | iex` makes the launcher runnable at once. It needs the explicit switch because PowerShell's success stream reaches `| iex` without the process's stdout ever being redirected, so there is no "am I being captured" test to key off.

### What persists where

| Path in container | Backing | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/workspace` | bind mount of `$PWD` | your repo — permanent |
| `~/.claude` | `claude-config-$USER` volume | auth, settings, plugins, session history — permanent |
| `~/.local` | `claude-local-$USER` volume | auto-updated Claude binary — permanent |
| `~/.codex` | `codex-config-$USER` volume | auth, `config.toml`, state DB — permanent |
| git identity (and, with `--sandbox-git`, a credential) | environment only | that session — never written to a volume or a file |
| everything else (`~/.cargo`, `~/.npm-global`, …) | container layer | discarded at session exit |

Plugins installed via `/plugin install` live in the config volume, so they persist and are shared across all of that user's projects.

**Remote Control:** Claude Code's Remote Control (steer sessions from the Claude app / claude.ai) currently cannot be combined with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the flags are mutually exclusive and the mobile UI re-prompts for approvals regardless (see [anthropics/claude-code#31908](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/31908)). Pick per session: autonomous (flag, monitor via tmux) or remote-steerable (type `/remote-control` in a session, approve from the app).

## Per-project toolchains

The images deliberately omit occasional-use toolchains (Java, Go, etc.). Projects self-provision into their own directories — no root needed, persists with the repo via the bind mount. Document the conventions in `CLAUDE.md` (Claude) / `AGENTS.md` (Codex) so autonomous sessions follow them instead of attempting `apt-get`:

```markdown
## Toolchain conventions
- Python: use a venv (`python3 -m venv .venv`); bare pip installs hit PEP 668.
- Java: no system JVM. Install Temurin into ./.jdk:
    curl -fsSL "https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/21/ga/linux/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/eclipse" | tar -xz -C .jdk --strip-components=1
  then export JAVA_HOME="$PWD/.jdk", PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH". Reuse existing ./.jdk.
- Other tools: static binaries go in ./.bin.
- Gitignore all of: .venv/ .jdk/ .bin/
- No root/sudo available; never attempt apt-get install.
```

## Multiple sessions and multiple users

- **Concurrent sessions (one user):** fully supported. Containers are independent; the shared volumes tolerate concurrency (this is the same as running the agent in several terminal tabs). The only real hazard is two sessions editing the *same checkout* — use `git worktree` for parallel work on one repo.
- **Multiple users (shared rootful Docker):** the `$USER`-namespaced images and volumes prevent *accidental* cross-user interference. They do **not** prevent deliberate access: anyone in the `docker` group can mount anyone's volume, because docker-group membership on a rootful daemon is root-equivalent. Treat this configuration as *collision-proof, not confidential*. If users on the box aren't mutually trusted with each other's agent credentials, use [rootless Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) per user instead — every user gets an isolated daemon and truly private volumes, and the installers work unchanged.
- **Why images are per-user too:** the container's `agent` user must have *your* UID, or the bind-mounted `/workspace` (owned by you on the host) isn't writable from inside — the agent reports something like "couldn't save, /workspace is owned by UID 1003 but this session runs as UID 1001." The installer passes `--build-arg UID/GID`, tags the image `*-$USER`, records the UID as an image label, and rebuilds automatically if your UID ever stops matching. It also detects volumes left owned by the wrong UID (the failure that breaks Codex's state DB) and repairs them in place, without losing your login. Docker layer caching keeps per-user images cheap: users with identical Dockerfiles share every layer up to the `useradd`.

If something looks wrong, `claude-sandbox --sandbox-doctor` (or `codex-sandbox --sandbox-doctor`) prints all of this state in one go — that's the first thing to run before filing an issue.

## Security notes

- **The container is the entire boundary.** In bypass/yolo mode, a prompt-injected or misbehaving session can do anything *inside* it: modify the mounted project, read the agent credentials in its volume, and reach the open network. Only run against repositories you trust.
- **Never mount host secrets** (`~/.ssh`, cloud credential files, `~/.gitconfig` with tokens) into the container. The launchers mount no host path but `$PWD`, and nothing here changes that: git identity and, with `--sandbox-git`, a git credential are passed as *environment*, resolved on the host, for one session.
- **A forwarded git credential is a real grant.** `--sandbox-git` is opt-in per launch for that reason. It is scoped to the origin remote's host, but within that host the token's own permissions apply, and an autonomous session that is prompt-injected can use it or exfiltrate it (egress is open — see below). Prefer a fine-grained, revocable token over one with broad `repo` scope, and leave the flag off when the agent has no reason to push. Identity alone (the default) carries no secret.
- **Egress is unrestricted by default** in these launchers. For defense against exfiltration, adapt the default-deny firewall from Anthropic's [reference devcontainer](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) (`init-firewall.sh` + `NET_ADMIN`/`NET_RAW` caps) — and be prepared to maintain a domain allowlist for package registries your projects use.
- **No Docker socket, no privileged flags.** The images contain no Docker client; if you ever add one, mounting the host Docker socket into an autonomous agent's container is a sandbox escape (root-equivalent on rootful daemons). Keep it out, or make it a conscious opt-in.
- **Non-root inside the container** (`agent` user) is required by Claude Code's bypass flag and is good hygiene for both agents regardless.
- **About `curl … | bash`.** It's the same delivery Claude Code itself uses, and it deserves the same scrutiny as any other. The scripts are plain, readable, and at a stable URL, so you can look first:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL .../install/claude.sh -o claude-install.sh
  less claude-install.sh
  bash claude-install.sh
  ```

  Two properties worth knowing: the script defines only functions until its final line (`main "$@"`), so a download that's cut short does nothing rather than half-installing — this is tested at six different truncation points — and it refuses to run as root.

## Development

`install/` is generated. Edit `src/` and rebuild:

```bash
tools/fetch-tools.sh --with-pwsh   # vendor shellcheck, bats, pwsh into ./.bin (no root)
tools/build.sh                     # src/ -> install/
tools/test.sh                      # build + lint + unit + integration (+ e2e if docker is up)
```

A single-file script can't `source` a sibling, so `tools/build.sh` inlines the shared library and embeds the Dockerfiles and launchers via two comment directives, `# @include` and `# @embed`. CI checks that the committed `install/` matches a fresh build.

The suite runs in tiers: shellcheck and PSScriptAnalyzer plus a portability guard that parses the generated installers with a real `bash:3.2` image; unit tests of the shared library; integration tests that drive the built installers and launchers against a scripted fake `docker` (covering upgrades, hand-edited files, dead daemons, wrong UIDs, failed builds, truncated downloads); and an end-to-end tier that builds real images and checks real UIDs, mounts and volumes. See `tests/`.

CI runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests: the freshness check above, lint plus unit and integration on Linux, the same suite on macOS under **bash 3.2** and BSD userland, real-Docker end-to-end, and a Windows job that exercises the PowerShell installers on a real Windows runner.

`CLAUDE.md` has the constraints worth knowing before changing anything — chiefly that bash 3.2 cannot parse a here-document inside `$( )`, and that the tests must not assume a Linux host.
